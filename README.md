 **Day 1: Basics of NMOS Drain Current (Id) vs Drain-to-source Voltage (Vds)**
 
 **Part 1: Introduction to Circuit Design and SPICE simulations**
 
 What was learnt:
•	The importance of W/L ratio

•	Need of SPICE

•	NMOS design and specifications

•	Threshold Voltage (Vt)

•	Concept of Strong Inversion

•	Impact of Source-to-bulk Voltage (Vsb)

•	Threshold Voltage Equation

V_t=V_t0+ϒ[(√(|-2ϕ_f+V_sb | ))-√(|-2ϕ_f | )]

•	Body Effect Coefficient expression

•	Fermi Potential Equation
